    "description": "<p>Another exciting lineup of Real World Elixir from expert practitioners this month. Also we welcome 2 new speakers!</p> <p><b>Hot Deploying with Distillery</b> - Jeffrey Chan</p> <p><br/>Jeffrey will take us through the process of taking your Elixir or Phoenix application and deploying it with Distillery and maybe even a little Docker. He'll also cover hot deployments which are some of the best kept secrets of the BEAM!</p> <p><b>Session Tracking with GenServers</b> - Martin Stannard</p> <p>Martin will deep dive into how Blake Education uses GenServers to track and analyse the interactions of high volumes of users on Reading Eggs and other products.</p> <p><b>Elixir Tooling: The Good and the Bad</b> - Luke Swithenbank</p> <p>Luke will cover the myriad of amazing tools at our disposal in the Elixir and Erlang ecosystem. We personally can't wait for the new code formatter to arrive in Elixir 1.6, but he'll also cover Dialyzer and Dialyxir for type checking your code. Credo for checking and ensuring consistent code style, HiPE, iEx and more. He'll also look at what opportunities there are for improvement in tooling and what you can do about it!</p> <p>\n\nElixir and Erlang developers of all levels are more than welcome, and if you're a complete beginner or just curious, then this a great chance to get started and get help from more experienced Elixir developers.</p> <p><br/>Thanks to Pivotal Labs for hosting us.</p> <p><br/>See you there,</p> <p><br/>Josh, James and Andrew</p> ",
