    <h2>About Elixir Sydney</h2>
    <p>
      We talk about Elixir and Erlang (and occasionally other things).
      A lot of us program for the web, so we've covered
      <%= link "Phoenix", to: "http://www.phoenixframework.org/", target: "_blank"%>
      and
      <%= link "Ecto", to: "https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/getting-started.html", target: "_blank"%>
       as well as migrating your projects from Ruby and Rails over to Elixir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently we've been introducing
      <%= link "OTP fundamentals", to: "http://www.erlang.org/", target: "_blank"%>
      from the very beginning so that we have a firm foundation in the underpinnings of what makes Elixir tick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take a look at our
      <%= link "past talks", to: "/meetups" %>
      for some slides and maybe the odd video.
