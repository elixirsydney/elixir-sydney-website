        This month we'll be talking about a topic that we haven't covered before, but is important for securing your webapps: Authentication with JWT and their usage with Plugs, Joken and Phoenix.

        We'll also be getting with writing Elixir in a recursive style. This may not be what you're used from other languages but it's pretty great in Elixir and Erlang. We'll learn how to write the ridiculously fast Elixir functions that are easy to read.

        Lastly we'll learn about what's new in Elixir 1.4 with a deep dive into the new Process Registry module.

        It's going to be a great meetup, so come along and join us!
